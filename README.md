BlackBird-Task 1

In this task, the team will perform a sequence of Git and GitHub actions with the help of GitHub CLI https://github.com/cli/cli

Git is one of the most popular Version Control System (VCS), that is used for tracking changes in any set of files. It is usually used for coordinating work amongst programmers, and collaboratively developing source code during software development.

This Git versioning system is usually complemented by GitHub, a cloud-based hosting service that lets us manage Git repositories, where we can do related things like creating a Pull Request (PR) along with conducting review and merging it.

The sequence of actions performed in this task will be a combination of Git and GitHub actions, from creating a repository on GitHub, pushing codebase from local, branching, and then creating, reviewing, and merging a PR.

In real-world use, this sequence can be put into a shell script (.sh) file to create an automated sequence, performing coordinated Git and GitHub actions.
